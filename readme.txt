 In this project, We'll dive into the Women's Clothing E-Commerce Reviews dataset, focusing on the 'Review Text' column filled with direct customer opinions.

Our mission is to use text embeddings and Python to analyze these reviews, uncover underlying themes, and understand customer sentiments. This analysis will help improve customer service and product offerings.
